      "The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous ''. \n",

      "\n",
      "The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments ''. \n",
      "\n",
      "Merger proposed \n",

      "However, the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration ''. \n",

      "The City Purchasing Department, the jury said, `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies ''. \n",

      "State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no -- and there were no dissents. \n",

      "Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. \n",
