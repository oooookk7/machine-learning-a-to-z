# [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python In Data Science (Udemy course)](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

This repository contains modified notebooks from a popular udemy machine learning course.

### Learner's Comments

The course doesn't really go into more details into the inner-workings of the algorithms, and the models uses the beginner tools like [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library primarily for visualising the data and the end-result of the expected model/algorithm. Much learning was done based on personal research alone instead of relying on the video lessons, and the learnings are documented into notes. There are some notebooks that aren't part of the original course that were created by me as part of the learning process (e.g. for reinforcement learning - q-learning, value/policy iteration notebooks, for clustering - dbscan, for association rule learning - fp-growth and modification of eclat notebook to use an actual eclat algorithm from a library).
