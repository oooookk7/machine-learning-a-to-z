# [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python In Data Science (Udemy course)](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

This repository contains modified notebooks from a popular udemy machine learning course.

### Learner's Comments

The course doesn't go in-depth in regards to the inner-workings of the algorithms (such as the mathematical equations), and uses tools like [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library (or other libraries) primarily for visualising the data for beginners to get a sense of the expected output and understand the underlying concepts. Hence, to make up for some of the details that I would like to know in learning this course, I took notes.

There are some notebooks that weren't part of the original course as they were created by me as part of the learning process (e.g. for reinforcement learning - q-learning, value/policy iteration notebooks, for clustering - dbscan, for association rule learning - fp-growth and modification of eclat notebook to use an actual eclat algorithm from a library).

## Setup

1. Ensure that `> python 3.6` is installed and Java JRE `8`.
2. Ensure that jupyter notebook [is installed](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Install Stanford CRF NER [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html), Stanford CoreNLP parser [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html) and unzip into `07`.

These are the notes for each of the sections,
