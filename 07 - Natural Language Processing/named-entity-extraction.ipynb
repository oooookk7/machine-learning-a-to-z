      "\"the environment ministry’s draft notification to regulate the use of membrane-based water purification systems primarily concerns the manufacturers of reverse osmosis (ro) water filters but effectively bars domestic users from installing ro systems. the notification is the culmination of a legal dispute before the national green tribunal, which had banned ro water filter use in delhi as the purification process wastes water. the association of water filter manufacturers challenged this order and the litigation led to this pan-india notification, where the intent is to conserve water and cut waste. in ro, the total dissolved solids (tds) in water — which covers trace chemicals, certain viruses, bacteria and salts — can be reduced, to meet potable water standards. for one, the notification implies, these filters are only prohibited if the home gets water supply that conforms to bureau of indian standards (bis) for drinking water. although several state and city water boards claim bis standards, the water at homes falls short of the test parameters. the bis norms are voluntary for public agencies which supply piped water but are mandatory for bottled water producers. the composite water management index (cwmi) of niti aayog says that 70% of water supply is contaminated. the aim is also to ensure that after 2022, no more than 25% of water being treated is wasted, and for residential complexes to reuse the residual waste water for other activities, including gardening. when implemented, the notification’s primary aim should be to persuade authorities to upgrade and supply bis-standard water at the consumer’s end.\"\n",
